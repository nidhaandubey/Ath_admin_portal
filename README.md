# 🛰️ Admin Portal: Sales Executive Location Tracking App

A React Native Admin Panel designed to **track sales executives’ live location and route history**. The app fetches location data from a real-time API and displays it on a map with proper markers, polylines, and timestamps.

This project simulates a **real enterprise tracking use-case** and demonstrates your ability to build powerful, production-ready mobile applications using native technologies.
